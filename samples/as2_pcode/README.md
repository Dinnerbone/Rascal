The files in here are more-or-less just generated by copy pasting the equivalent AS2 code into Flash, compiling it,
opening the resulting SWF in FFDEC, and copying the resulting pcode here.

It doesn't necessarily have to come from FFDEC, or be the same as from the AS2 file, but it's a convenient starting
point.
